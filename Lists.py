# List are arrays in other programming languages.

list = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']

# list are indexed, starting at 0. Cat is position 0, bat is position 1 and so on.

list[2] #rat

#can start index in negative like -1 which is the last element from end to start position.
# for example : list[-1] is elephant.

list[1:3] #goes from position 1, bat, to rat, because 3 is not included
#this is called slice
#can use slices to replace elements inside a list
